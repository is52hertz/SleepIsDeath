Sleep is Death (Geisterfahrer)
An asymmetric storytelling game for two players by Jason Rohrer

http://sleepisdeath.net




Designed for a LAN:

1. Set up two computers on your local network (WiFi or Wire).

2. Plugging two computers directly together with a single Ethernet cable also 
   works.

3. Start one as Controller.

4. Give the Player the Controller's IP address as displayed by the game.

5. If the Controller and Player are in the same room, give the Controller 
   headphones.

6. Don't look at each other's screens. 

7. Enjoy each other's company.



Possible to play over the Internet:

1. Player should work fine with any reliable Internet connection.

2. Controller must be able to receive incoming connections.

3. Controller tries to use UPnP to open a port on your router and determine
   your external IP address.  This should work automatically on most modern 
   routers.


4. If UPnP doesn't work:

5. By default, Controller listens on port 7778.

6. Set up Port Forwarding, DMZ, or Static IP for the Controller on your DSL
   or Cable Modem's router.

5. Give the Player your real, EXTERNAL IP address. 
   Try a service like   http://www.whatismyip.com/
   Probably does not start with 192.168...  (that's your internal IP).

6. If 7778 doesn't work for you, change it in settings/port.ini
   Make sure the Player changes his or her port.ini to match yours.
