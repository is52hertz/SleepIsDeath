<font size=6>Shannon Galvin's Contributions</font><br>
<table border=0 width="100%" cellpadding=5><tr><td bgcolor="#222222">
Shannon Galvin worked at Maxis starting back in 1994 and all
the way up through <i>Spore</i>, where he did concept art and 3D modeling (remember
the plants and the huts---that was him!).  He's currently
working as lead 3D artist on Jonathan Blow's upcoming game <i>The Witness</i>.
<br>
<br>
He made a full set of resources that he used to tell me a pretty great story, which you can flip through here:

</center>
<br>
<br>
He also packed all of this stuff up into a <b>resource pack</b>, which is available for free to everyone who bought download access to the game.  You can use his stuff to tell your own stories, or just poke at it to figure out how he made all those subtle shading effects.
