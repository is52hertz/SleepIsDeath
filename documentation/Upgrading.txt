Instructions for upgrading from previous versions to v16.

To transfer your resources across:

1. PLEASE make and keep a backup of your old game directory.  I would be sad if
   you lost any of your hard work, through your error or my error.

2. COPY (don't move) your old "resourceCache" folder INTO the "importOldCache"
   folder in v16.

3. Start the v16 game, and enter Controller mode.  This will "pause" for
   longer than normal after you hit "G" (before the Controller mode is shown),
   while your old resources are merged and upgraded.  This will only happen
   once, so be patient.

4. After the Controller mode loads, check that your resources have been
   imported correctly.


v16 is compatible in every way with v15.



v13 Packs can be loaded into v16, but they will trigger a similar pause at
startup (while they are converted).

v14 Packs can be loaded into v16.


v15/v16 Packs are NOT compatible with v13.  

v15/v16 Packs are compatible with v14 as long as they do not contain 
Color Palette resources.  


v16 should be able to both host and play against v14.

v16 CANNOT host games for a v13 player (the objects sent across now have more
information in them that v13 cannot handle).  v13 should be able to host a 
v16 player, however.
